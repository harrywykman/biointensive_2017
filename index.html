					<h2>What is Biointensive Gardening?</h2>
					<blockquote>
						At its core, biointensive gardening is a closed
						gardening system that seeks to meet the needs of a human
						diet, without depleting soil.

					<h3>Crops in Proportion</h3>
					<ul>
						<li class="fragment fade-up">
							<strong>CARBON &mdash; 60%</strong>
							<br/> Over half of the area of a biointensive garden is devoted to growing crops that are high in carbon
						</li>
						<li class="fragment fade-up">
							<strong>CALORIES &mdash; 30%</strong>
							<br/> Nearly a third is grown to root crops that produce a high calorific value in a limited space
						</li>
						<li class="fragment fade-up">
							<strong>VITAMINS AND MINERALS &mdash; 10%</strong>
							<br/> One tenth is planted to vegetable crops that provide us with vitmains and minerals

					</section>

					<section class="trans-bg-1" data-background-image="static/img/vegetables/CHEN_Spinach1.jpg">
						<p>The biointensive gardening method seeks to answer the
							question

							"What would it take to feed the world on the

							<li>
								Biointensive gardening addresses large scale

							<strong>Biointensive gardening is planning and

						"In such a culture the primitive condition of the soil is of little account, because loam is made out of the old forcing beds &hellip; almost every plant is treated individually."

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>"In this culture each plant is treated according to its age. The seeds germinate and the seedlings develop their first four leaflets in especially favorable conditions of soil and temperature; then the best seedlings are picked out and transplanted into a bed of fine loam, under a frame or in the open air, where they freely develop their rootlets, and, gathered on a limited space, receive more than usual care. Only after this preliminary training are they bedded in the open ground, where they grow till ripe. In such a culture the primitive condition of the soil is of little account, because loam is made out of the old forcing beds … almost every plant is treated individually." &mdash; <strong>Peter Kropotkin</strong>, <em>Fields, Factories and Workshops of Tomorrow</em></p>

						“… special calorie root crops, such as potatoes, sweet potatoes, leeks, onions, garlic, salsify, parsnips and Jerusalem artichokes, can enable us to grow, per unit of area, as much as five times, or more, the calories as can be produced with soybeans per unit of area and time.”

					<p><strong>Permaculture is about design.</strong></p>
					<p>The biointensive method is a <strong>designed approach</strong> to the production of nutrient dense food through a resource conserving production method.</p>

				<section>
					<h3>The Biointensive Framework as Design Tool</h3>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p>The biointensive research framework allows design questions to be posed and answered.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>"What portion of my diet can I grow given the space I have available?"</li>
						<li>"What set of crops will give me the most calories for area?"</li>
						<li>"What set of crops will provide me the most critical nutrients for my diet?"</li>
						<li>"How many plants of a particular crop will I need to fill 5 m2 of space?"</li>
						<li>"How much space will 200 tomato plants take up at 60 cm spacing?"</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>A set of standard practices and parameters (eg. std. garden bed size; plant spacing etc.) facilitate the answering of these questions during a design phase.</p>
